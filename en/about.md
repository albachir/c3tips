> New year, new project. **A C3 tip per day!**

With great excitement, I introduce these short and useful daily C3 tips that will allow you to improve your skills. With less than 2 minutes each day, you will be able to read about performance, conventions, hacks, and all the items that the future of this awesome platform holds for us.

At midday, no matter if it is a weekend or a holiday, a tip will be posted and tweeted.
